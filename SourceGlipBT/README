glip is a Git Library In PHP. It allows you to access bare git repositories
from PHP scripts, even without having git installed. The project's homepage is
located at <http://fimml.at/glip>.

The glip-devel mailing list at <glip-devel@fimml.at> is intended for both users
and developers to discuss development and issues with the library. The mailing
list archives can be found at <http://lists.fimml.at/glip-devel/>.


glip was formerly part of eWiki, a wiki software written in PHP using git as
version control backend. You can get more information on eWiki from
<http://fimml.at/ewiki>.

glip was split off eWiki on May 31, 2009. An attempt was made to preserve
commit history by using git filter-branch; this also means that commit
messages before May 31, 2009 may seem weird (esp. wrt file names).
