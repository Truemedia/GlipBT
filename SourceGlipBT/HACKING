=== Coding Style ===

NO TRAILING SPACES!
vimrc snippet: au Syntax * syn match Error /\s\+$/ containedin=ALL

Curly brackets have their own line, always. No empty lines directly at the
beginning/end of a block. Spaces: never after function names, always after
control statements.

Class definitions:
    - Variables
    - One-line functions
    - Long functions

Function definitions are separated with empty lines.

NO empty lines at the beginning/end of any block.

PHP closing tags are intentionally omitted.


=== Git Policy ===

Summaries in present-tense half-sentences preferred (no full stop)

Renaming Files: please do so in a separate commit with renames _only_ so
changes can easily be tracked.

Try to commit as often as possible.
