ABOUT

GipBT is designed for two purposes. To allow MantisBT to display information on git repositories located on your server without the use of gitweb, 
and use git functions without the command line.

The solution to achieve this is having the git library but coded in php (glip) which is a project that has already being persued, 
and a MantisBT plugin based on the original gitweb plugin but modified to suit this new method of working with less requirements.
